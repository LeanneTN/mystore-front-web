# mystore-front-web
web front-end of project "My Store", an online shopping website

## Introduction
This project is written by original javascript and jQuery without using widely used framework like vue or React.

It is mainly used as a project which can help me imporve my front-end skill, and the frenquency of writting javascript,
which I have barely no time to practice but important.

This project will mainly using ES5 as major version of method to write js, and it will continuely find the unfriendly or
improper coding style which was changed in ES6. I believe it is a better way to handle the ES6 grammar.

Project is managed by webpack, and it is following the document which I released in back-end api project.

After finishing this version, it will be rewrite in React, which language I have not used before.

# mystore-front-web
web front-end of project "My Store", an online shopping website

## Introduction
This project is written by original javascript and jQuery without using widely used framework like vue or React.

It is mainly used as a project which can help me imporve my front-end skill, and the frenquency of writting javascript,
which I have barely no time to practice but important.

This project will mainly using ES5 as major version of method to write js, and it will continuely find the unfriendly or
improper coding style which was changed in ES6. I believe it is a better way to handle the ES6 grammar.

But because vscode appears annoyed underline on some ES5 grammar, I will use some ES6 like let and so on in some specific 
places

Project is managed by webpack, and it is following the document which I released in back-end api project.

After finishing this version, it will be rewrite in React, which language I have not used before.

Actually, during the writing of this project, it slowly shows the structure of modern front-end frameworks like React and 
Vue. Hope you can generally find it as this is the meaning I wrote this. Try to feel why the ES6 and React will appear and
how they designed like what they are now is really an interesting thing to do.
